# Web-dev-Assignment-01
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and interests as a budding software engineer. Built using pure HTML, it's designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to navigate.

structure of my portfolio
1. Welcome message
2. Education
3. About me
4. Projects
5. Language skills
6. My contacts
7. Contact me form

I have added information about my education as an unordered list, language skills in a table format, another unordered list for my projects and added a form for the reader to contact me in case.
I have used images as links to my various social media profiles including github and linkedin.

I will keep updating and use this portfolio as my cv profile for people who want to know about my skills, education and tech stack.
