# Web-dev-Assignment-01
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and interests as a budding software engineer. Built using pure HTML, it's designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to navigate.

I have added information about my education as an unordered list, language skills in a table format, another unordered list for my projects and added a form for the reader to contact me in case.
i have used images as links to my various social media profiles including github and linkedin.


i will use this portfolio as my cv profile for people who want to know about my skills, education and tech stack.
